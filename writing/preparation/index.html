            <p>
                The antibacterial green glow of the terminal screen casted an odd shadow on Siras' frown
                and made it seem more ghastly than usual. A faint creak startled him and he
                whipped around in his comandeered Aeron chair, eyes wide. There was nothing and
                nobody in the building, of course--he hadn't spent those five years in the hills
                of the Himalayas harvesting and synthesizing the milk of the limberio tree into
                the world's most untraceable neurotoxin just to haphazardly leave a security
                guard alive on his way in. He stared at the door back to the hallway from the
                mainframe for another twenty seconds to put his mind at ease. The leg of the
                last guard was still sticking lifeless into the mainframe room. He had put up
                quite a fight, but Siras hadn't spent a whole decade on a Tibetan mountain training to be a triple
                black-belt in Karate to be bested by some rent-a-cop with a holstered can of
                mace.
            </p>

            <p>
                He turned back towards the mainframe terminal. The cursor at the shell prompt
                winked at him.

            <p>
                Siras hadn't spent fifteen years tailing John Kimmel Brown, reading every news
                article about him, rifling through his cans every garbage day (Tuesday mornings
                at 6:15 AM from 2000-2010, then Recology decided they'd switch to Wednesday
                mornings starting in 2011. For the first half of 2011 Siras would still check on
                Tuesday mornings, as he knew that J.K. Brown was a creature of habit) just to be
                foiled this far into this job, his calling, the whole reason he was put on this planet.

                Turtles: J.K. Brown's favorite animal. Twelve, the number of turtles he'd owned
                in his lifetime, including one tortoise. A bead of sweat formed at Siras' brow.
                He hit enter. The bead fell precipitously onto the knuckle of his right ring
                finger.

            <p>
                He was in. His heart skipped a beat, and for a second he felt that same faint,
                spinning feeling that he experienced after he won the grand championship prize
                at the World Series of Poker. He had spent twenty-two years studying Texas
                hold-'em poker and behavioral psychology so he could win that tournament and
                finance this job. He knew he couldn't rest on his laurels, but he decided to allow
                himself one victorious fist-pump before he continued on to the coup de grace. He
                hadn't spent thirty years at the Royal Oxford Academy of Fist Pumping and Other
                Dramatic Gestures just to make it this far and not be able to prematurely
                celebrate correctly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just as he was winding up for the most royally dramatic gesture of his lifetime,
                he noticed that bead of sweat was still on the knuckle of his right ring finger.
                His face drained itself of all its color, and he felt a sinking feeling--the
                same kind that he felt during his first submarine driving lesson. He had spent
                thirty-six years studying submarining so that he could arrive surreptitiously in
                San Francisco by way of the Bay for this job.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was too late to stop the fist pump now--his professors at the Royal Academy
                had done an excellent job teaching him. He finished the extension of his fist in
                a textbook Serpentine twist, and the little bead of sweat launched from his
                knuckle towards the ceiling. He watched in slow-motion as the little droplet
                zeroed in on its target: a small silver disc embedded in the pristine white
                ceiling tile. It met its destiny, and Siras sat in silence staring above for
                what felt like eons. When enough time had passed, he realized he hadn't tripped
                the moisture sensor. He let out a sigh of relief.
            </p>

            <p>
                "AUDIO ALARM ACTIVATED! RED ALERT, CODE 52A!"
            </p>

            <p>
                That was his death knell. He hadn't spent forty years studying corporate
                security routines and klaxons to not know that a Code 52A meant that a
                heavily-armed SWAT team was on their way to his location. They'd be there in
                minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Siras didn't expect to die on this job, but he knew that what he was
                doing was bigger than himself. After fifty-seven years of preparation, he felt
                at peace. He had just enough time to complete his task.
            </p>

            <pre>
            root@mainframe $&gt; vim |
            </pre>

            <p>
                He could hear the stomp of tactical boots echoing from the staircase--probably
                down in the lobby--all the way up into the hall.
            </p>

            <pre>
            root@mainframe $&gt; vim /www/site/index.css |
            </pre>

            <p>
                The frantic steps got louder. He hit enter. The file took up the entirety of the
                terminal, and he mashed the keyboard until he arrived where he needed to be.
            </p>

            <pre class="preserve-tabs">
.submit-button {
    margin: 10px;
    padding-top: 10px;
    padding-bottom: 9px; |
}
            </pre>

            <p>
                His muscle memory kicked in. He hadn't spent sixty years studying the VIM text
                editor to make it this far and not know how to change one number to another
                number. He heard the unmistakable sound of a handgun being cocked. The SWAT team
                was at the end of the hall. He made the change.
            </p>

            <pre class="preserve-tabs">
.submit-button {
    margin: 10px;
    padding-top: 10px;
    padding-bottom: 10px;
}
            </pre>

            <p>
                He frantically hit save, just as he heard the team kick open the door.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Step away from the terminal now!"
            </p>

            <p>
                He couldn't comply, he had to make sure he had accomplished his goal.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I'll give you until the count of three! One.."
            </p>

            <p>
                Siras opened up a web browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Two!"
            </p>

            <p>
                He typed http://google.com/ in the address bar.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Three!"
            </p>

            <p>
                He pressed enter as the report from the officer's gun rang out in his ears, and
                there was a splatter of blood on the terminal screen. He felt cold, but as the
                Google homepage loaded he could see that the text of the "Search" button was
                finally centered vertically. He could die happy. He had prepared sixty-seven
                years for the end.
